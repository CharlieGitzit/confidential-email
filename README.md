Beginning to keep track of projects completed from Freecodecamp's new beta version for Full-Stack Web Development, along with The Odin Project completed work. Figured I mine as well - considering I'm in no position to overlook any progress. Still odd to me because not too long ago, creation seemed so out of reach. Cheers!
